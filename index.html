      <h2>Leatherback Sea Turtle</h2>

      <p>The largest sea turtle specie is vunerable to extintion...</p>
      <p>Leatherback sea turtles are known for their size, leather-like shell, and lack of scales. They are also the most migratory specie, crossing both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Despite the gobal status being labeled "Vunerable," many large subpopulations, such as the Pacific, are "Critically Endangered." Leatherback turtles consume large numbers of jellyfish and are crucial to keeping their population in check. Unfortunately, since leatherbacks feel almost exculsivly on jelly fish, they are susceptible to consuming plastic bags. Populations have heavily declined over the years due to overharvesting and interactions with fisheries, which they are more susceptible to because of their long migrations. With rising sea levels and human activites, sea turtle nesting beaches and feeding grounds have been destroyed all around the world. </p>

      <h2>Green Sea Turtle</h2>
      <h5>The Miscellanista. August 12, 2019</h5>

      <p>Green sea turtles are loved around the world, however, they are not cared for. </p>
      <p>Much like leatherbacks, green sea turtles are endagered due to overharvesting of their eggs, hunting of adults, being caught in nets, and loss of their nesting beaches. Green sea turtles maintain seagrass beds and make them more productive by feeding on it and algae. These seagrass beds function as nurseries for several other species of fish, many of which are important to our own food security. Similar to leatherbacks and many other species of turtles, they are known to mistakenly consume plastic bags. </p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I've always loved sea tutles. My favorite specie of sea turtle is the leatherback sea turtle. Advocacy for the preservation of sea turtles and their habitats is very important to me!</p>
